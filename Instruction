To run a animator, you need a file which contains all the shapes and shapes' information such as appearing time, disappearing
time, color, detailed adjustion.
Here are 4 demos
In the command line, the formate is "-if demo1.txt -iv interactive -speed 20" as an example. "if" is the input file name, "iv"
is how you would like to present the animation. It could be "text", which will show the animation in text. It could be "svg",
which will generate a svg file, and you can open it in a broswer. It could be "visual", which will present the animation in an
window. It also could be "interactive", which is the advanced visual, and you can export, adjust the process, select the 
appearing shapes, change the color of background. "speed" is the speed of the animation.
